# ViewModel explained in Laravel 5.4
I often encounter a situation where I need to retrieve data from more than one table in database. the data has to be displayed in view. This usually ends up messy code in controller class. The solution is to implement ViewModel which is a class to maintain data which is displayed in a specific view. This allows you to alleviate any logic in view and reuse any other view.
